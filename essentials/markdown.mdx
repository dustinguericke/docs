## Overview

The signals beacon is an embeddable tracker that captures signals corresponding to user actions, like searches and purchases. With no coding and minimal configuration, you can quickly start sending signals to Lucidworks Platform, including all of the data needed to power your signals analytics.

At a high level, the tracking flow begins when a user visits the site and performs one or more searches. These searches generate query identifiers that associate user actions with specific queries. As the user interacts with search results and shows interest in a product, additional signals such as clicks and cart events are captured. If the user completes a purchase, the flow concludes with a purchase signal that links the transaction back to the original query. This process enables end-to-end tracking of user behavior from search to purchase.

In this scenario, the signals beacon uses several primary tracking mechanisms:

- **Visitor ID**: A randomly generated identifier stored in local browser storage. It is unique to both the visitor and the device. It persists across sessions.
- **Session ID**: A randomly generated identifier stored in session storage. It expires after 40 minutes of inactivity or when the browser session ends. When the user returns, a new session ID is generated, but the visitor ID remains the same.
- **Query ID**: A randomly generated identifier created when a search query is submitted. It is temporarily stored in memory and is included with signal events related to that query, such as clicks or purchases.
- **Cart ID**: A unique identifier created when a product is added to the cart. It links cart interactions and purchases to the originating query. After a purchase, a new cart ID is generated to track subsequent transactions independently.

The signal event flow below outlines a simplified sequence of common events. Additional signal types and behaviors are not included in this summary:

1. When a user visits the site, a visitor ID and session ID are generated.
2. When a query is submitted, a query ID is generated and a query signal is sent. This signal includes the visitor ID and session ID.
3. For each new query, a new query ID is generated and another query signal is sent.
4. When the user clicks on a product, a click signal is sent. This signal includes the associated query ID.
5. When the user adds a product to their cart, a cart ID is generated and a cart-add signal is sent.
6. When the user purchases a product, a purchase signal is sent. This signal includes the current cart ID, which allows the purchase to be traced back to the original query. After the signal is sent, the cart ID is replaced with a new one to track future transactions independently.

## Configure the signals beacon

To see your signals analytics in Lucidworks Platform, you must configure the signals beacon as explained in this topic.

The beacon sends signals to the:

- [Signals store](/lw-platform/analytics/88pjp2/signals-store) for storage and aggregation
- [Analytics Studio service](/lw-platform/analytics/10aut8/index), which provides insights about actions taken by users on your site

Import content from `/lw-platform/lw-analytics/signals/index.asciidoc` tagged with `signals-collected`.

For additional context, see [Overview of signals process](/lw-platform/analytics/0le96f/signals).

### Prerequisites

You must be a workspace owner to configure the signals beacon. Before you begin:

- Analyze your site for compatibility with the signals beacon. Your site should use URL query parameters (`?q=foo`).
- Ensure the following fields are available in the DOM as attributes or text nodes:
  - Product ID
  - Product title
  - Product image URL
  - Product price
  - Product URL
- Identify additional fields to capture, noting their CSS paths.
- Create a [signals store](/lw-platform/analytics/88pjp2/signals-store).

### Install the beacon

1. Open the app and navigate to *Integrations*.
2. If no beacon exists, click *Generate* to create a token.
3. In *Allowed Origins*, enter domains in the format `<scheme>://<hostname>[:<port>]`.
4. Enable the *Signals Beacon* toggle.
5. Click *Copy* to get the script and insert it in the `<head>` tag of your HTML.
6. Edit the JSON configuration. See:
   - [Example JSON configuration](#example-json-configuration)
   - [Example signals script](#example-signals-script)
   - [Field path configuration](#field-path-configuration)
   - [Beacon Configuration Interface](/lw-platform/analytics/k6vyeq/beacon-configuration-interface)
7. Click *Apply*. Configuration takes effect immediately.

To inspect captured fields, use `window.logBeaconInfo()` in the browser.
