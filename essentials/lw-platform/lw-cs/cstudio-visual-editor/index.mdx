* In the **Document ID Field**, enter the field to be used as the document ID when retrieving metrics from the Signals Store. The default is `id`. 
* In the **Add Up to 3 Metrics** field, you can select any or all of the following metrics to display for the item (and the amount of time selected in the **Metrics Duration** field):

  * **Purchases.** Displays the number of purchases related to this item.
  * **Revenue.** Displays the revenue related to this item.
  * **RPV.** Revenue per visit displays the average revenue received per visit for the item for the time period specified in the **Metrics Duration** field.

  * **CVR.** Conversion rate is also referred to as search conversion rate. The search conversion rate measures the percentage of searches that result in a completed purchase. This metric represents the final step in the user journey from query to conversion, offering a clear indicator of overall search effectiveness and customer satisfaction. For example, a conversion rate of 5% means that 5 out of every 100 searches lead to a purchase.
