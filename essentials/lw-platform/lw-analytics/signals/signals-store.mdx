The signals store is the repository in your Lucidworks Platform workspace that holds query, click, cart-add, purchase, and facet usage signals gathered from customer interactions on your site.

## Create a Signal Store

One of the tasks to use signals is to create a repository to store signals. 
. Sign in to [Lucidworks Platform](https://platform.lucidworks.com).

1. In the navigation bar, select the workspace that will access the signals store.
2. Click **Analytics Studio**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a unique user-defined for the signals store.
2. In the **Region** field, select the geographical area for the signal store.

   **📌 NOTE**\
   This selection cannot be changed. If you need a signal store in a different region, you need to create another signal store with the other region specified.
3. Click **Create**.
After the signal store is created, you can configure the [signals beacon](/lw-platform/analytics/k649vy/signals-beacon).

## Signal fields stored

## Technical components

The properties of each signal store include:

* User-defined name.
* Universally unique identifier (`uuid`) of the signals store.
* Location of the signal store, which is also referred to as a data cell

The `uuid` and `data cell` define the endpoint where the signals are sent. For example, `<signals_store.uuid>.signals.lucidworks.com` is a `CNAME` to the appropriate data cell endpoint.

For more information about signals, see [signals](/lw-platform/analytics/0le96f/signals).
