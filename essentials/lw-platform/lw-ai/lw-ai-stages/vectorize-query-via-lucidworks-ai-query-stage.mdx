Lucidworks AI Vectorize Query is a Fusion query pipeline stage that generates a vector based on the current query string (q parameter).

To use this stage, non-admin Fusion users must be granted the `POST:/LWAI-ACCOUNT-NAME/**` permission in Fusion, which is the Lucidworks AI API Account Name defined in the Lucidworks AI Gateway service when this stage is configured.

More detailed information to configure this stage is in [Configure Lucidworks AI vector search](/how-to/6bl4nm/configure-lucidworks-ai-vector-search).

**‚ùó IMPORTANT**\
This query stage must be placed _before_ the **[Solr Query stage](/fusion/{latest-fusion}/265/solr-query-stage)**.

## Configuration

**üí° TIP**\
When entering configuration values in the UI, use _unescaped_ characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use _escaped_ characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.
