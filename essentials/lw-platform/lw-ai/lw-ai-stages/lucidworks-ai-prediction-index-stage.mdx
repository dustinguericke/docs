The Lucidworks AI Prediction index stage is a general purpose integration between Fusion and Lucidworks AI.

By default, the Fusion `Call Asynchronously?` field is selected, which specifies this stage uses the [Lucidworks AI Async Prediction API](/lw-platform/ai/55ug0f/async-prediction-api) endpoints.

If the Fusion `Call Asynchronously?` field is _not_ selected, this stage uses the [Lucidworks AI Prediction API](/lw-platform/ai/8bx4m9/prediction-api) endpoints.

To use this stage, non-admin Fusion users must be granted the `POST:/LWAI-ACCOUNT-NAME/**` permission in Fusion, which is the Lucidworks AI API Account Name defined in the Lucidworks AI Gateway service when this stage is configured.

More detailed information to configure this stage is in [Configure the Lucidworks AI Prediction index stage](/how-to/ua7khh/configure-fusion-lwai-prediction-index-stage).

## Configuration

**ðŸ’¡ TIP**\
When entering configuration values in the UI, use _unescaped_ characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use _escaped_ characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.
