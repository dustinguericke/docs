Lucidworks AI Vectorize Field is a Fusion index pipeline stage that invokes a Lucidworks AI model to encode a string field to a vector representation.

To use this stage, non-admin Fusion users must be granted the `POST:/LWAI-ACCOUNT-NAME/**` permission in Fusion, which is the Lucidworks AI API Account Name defined in the Lucidworks AI Gateway service when this stage is configured.

More detailed information to configure this stage is in [Configure Lucidworks AI vector search](/how-to/6bl4nm/configure-lucidworks-ai-vector-search). 

## Configuration

**ðŸ’¡ TIP**\
When entering configuration values in the UI, use _unescaped_ characters, such as `\t` for the tab character. When entering configuration values in the API, use _escaped_ characters, such as `\\t` for the tab character.
