In the Summarization use case of the [LWAI Prediction API](/lw-platform/ai/8bx4m9/prediction-api), the LLM ingests text and returns a summary of the text as a response. 

The context length is 2048 tokens. No options can be configured.

This use case can be used to condense the text of a large document into a summarized response.

## Prerequisites

* The `USE_CASE` and `MODEL_ID` fields for the use case request. The path is: `/ai/prediction/USE_CASE/MODEL_ID`. A list of supported models is returned in the [Lucidworks AI Use Case API](/lw-platform/ai/0stpyb/use-case-api). For more information about supported models, see [Generative AI models](/lw-platform/ai/r7ai90/generative-ai#generative-ai-models).

## Common parameters and fields 

### modelConfig

Some parameters of the `/ai/prediction/USE_CASE/MODEL_ID` request are common to all of the generative AI (GenAI) use cases, including the `modelConfig` parameter. If you do not enter values, the following defaults are used.

### Unique values for the summarization use case

The values available in this use case (that may not be available in other use cases) are:

|====

|Parameter |Value

|"text" |Free-form content contained in the document.

|"useCaseConfig" |"maxWords": integer

This parameter specifies the maximum number of words returned in the summary when generated by the model.

|====

### Example request

This example does not include `modelConfig` parameters, but you can submit requests that include parameters described in [Common parameters and fields](#common-parameters-and-fields).

      "text": "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys'\'' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too."
      },

      "maxWords": 100
    }

The following is an example response:

```json
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "tokensUsed": {
       "promptTokens": 248,
       "completionTokens": 65,
       "totalTokens": 313
       },
      "response": "A decade after the Dursleys found their nephew on their doorstep, Privet Drive remains largely unchanged. The only noticeable difference is in the family photographs, which now depict Dudley Dursley as a large blond boy engaged in various activities, replacing his baby pictures. There is no indication of another boy living in the house."
      }
    ]
  }
